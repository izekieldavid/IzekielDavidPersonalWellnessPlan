							<h2>PHYSICAL HEALTH</h2>

						</header>
						<p align="justify">
						I’m aware of the benefits of being physically healthy. 
						I’m already physically active not only in sports but also in my 
						daily routine. I enjoy my daily exercises like riding a bike, jogging and playing basketball. 
						Even though my time is spent on my online classes, I tend to do something physically once I have my free time. 
						I feel good doing it and it relaxes me but while doing all of this I know how to limit my activities because doing 
						it every day can wear off your body. Sometimes it’s good to be physically active but remember to always take care of 
						your body like drinking plenty of 
						water and  eating foods to replenish your energy and take a rest.

							<h2>MENTAL WELLNESS</h2>

						<p aling="justify">
						Our physical, financial , and social stability requires mental health. 
						It has an impact on how we think, sound and behave. 
						It also assists in deciding how we cope with tension, 
						how we react to others and how we make decisions.
						Inorder for me to achieve my mental wellness, having a plenty of sleep a day is a must.
						keeping a healthy diet, doing my hobbies, learn to manage stress, and lastly don't be independent,
						sometimes depending and talking on someone can be of great help.

							<h2>EMOTIONAL WELLNESS</h2>
							<p class="info"></p>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">
						The Emotional wellbeing of a person is a major component of mental wellness. 
						Emotionally stable individuals are in control of their emotions, desires, and behaviours. 
						They are ready to take on the challenges of life. They will keep challenges in view, and recover from losses.
						In order to achieve this, I must be aware of my emotions and reactions especially in time where I'm stressed out. 
						I should always think before I act like when expressign my feelings in a appropriate way.
						Lastly, learn to be connected with others. You don't have to be afraid of being emotionally open to others but always remember that 
						it should be someone that you are close with.

							<h2>SOCIAL WELLNESS</h2>
							<p class="info"></p>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">
						Social wellbeing refers to the interactions we have with people, and how we communicate.
						During challenging times our relationships can provide help. 
						Social wellbeing means creating safe, caring, and positive relationships, and cultivating a 
						meaningful bond with those around you. Other people who don't want to be socially active tend to be lonely and forget 
						that they always have someone to depend on. Sometimes loneliness can lead to symptoms such as depression. 
						To avoid this circumstances remember to make an effort to keep in touch with supportive friends and family.
						Participate in group discussions and practice active listening. Start small if you're too insecure, it can be your closest friend or even a circle of friends.

							<h2>SPIRITUAL WELLNESS </h2>
							<p class="info">3 days ago by <a href="#">Jane Doe</a></p>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">
						Not only does spiritual wellbeing encourage you to discover meaning and reason of human nature, 
						it also encourages you to enjoy your life experiences for what they are. 
						You'll be able to create a balance between your own self and the outer world as you find meaning in your life experiences.
						In order to achieve spiritual wellness, I should always see things in diferent perspectives, in a way that is delivered in a positive way. 
						Try not to judge directly but to understand carefully. Lastly, always do good things, and learn to be better.
